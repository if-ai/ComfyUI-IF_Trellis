ComfyUI TRELLIS is a large 3D asset generation in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of TRELLIS is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for SLAT as the powerful backbones.

### Prerequisites
- **System**: The original code is currently tested only on **Linux**.  For windows setup, you may refer to [#3](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/3)
- (This comfyui node is following this suggeted installation steps It works but you need to follow the steps as described in part one and two of the guide).
- Windows users need to use the Win_requirements.txt.
- Linux Users (Not tested Yet) use the linux_requirements.txt but I am still testing if it works with comfy in Linux I just added the original repo requirements.
  
- **Hardware**: This repo improve memmory mangement with the PR made by Amorano you will need NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB.  
- **Software**:   
  - The [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) is needed to compile certain submodules. The code has been tested with CUDA versions 11.8 and 12.2.  This repo use **CUDA 12.4**.
  - [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) is recommended for managing dependencies.  
  - Python version 3.8 or higher is required. 

  Give unrestricted script access to powershell so venv can work:

- Open an administrator powershell window
- Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` and answer A
- Close admin powershell window

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    cd ComfyUI/Custom_nodes
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/if-ai/ComfyUI-IF_Trellis.git
    ```
## MUST HAVE `--recurse-submodules`

ONLY tested on windows but it should work easier in Linux without any issues or needing such specific stuffs.
***NOT tested or compatible with PORTABLE comfy embeded python env***
watch quick overview of setting the env if needed
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-vEpuYL9I3g/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vEpuYL9I3g)

You need to set up the environment first
follow this guide for the first part

Set the VSCode Cpp Envirronment as in the guide

<!-- Installation -->
## ðŸ“¦ Second part of the installation

Activate youur comfy environment
```
(gen) PS D:\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-IF_Trellis> micromamba activate gen
```
If you haven't set your vars or for some reason it can't compile some of this specially `nvdiffrast`
it doesn't hurt if you do it again now.
```
cmd.exe /c "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64 "&&" powershell
```

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **High Quality**: It produces diverse 3D assets at high quality with intricate shape and texture details.
- **Versatility**: It takes text or image prompts and can generate various final 3D representations including but not limited to *Radiance Fields*, *3D Gaussians*, and *meshes*, accommodating diverse downstream requirements.
- **Flexible Editing**: It allows for easy editings of generated 3D assets, such as generating variants of the same object or local editing of the 3D asset.
